# Hangman Instructions

## Game Rules

- The system will generate a new word for each game that you play.
- Pick a letter from the letter pad, on the right-hand side of the screen.
- For each incorrect letter that you select an element of the hangman will appear in the img on the left-hand side of the screen.
- If you select 10 incorrect letters you lose the game and you will be moved onto the next word.
- If you get the word correct, you will be awarded 10 pts and moved onto the next word.
- If at any point you get stuck you can select the "Hint" button to get a single correct letter given to you. However this will dock your points total by 2pts.
- If you hit the "Restart" button, this will reset the entire game and you will lose all of your points and progress.
